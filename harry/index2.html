                    <span class="acrostic-letter">A</span> union of complimentary elements is what we see in his parents. We have Kelli, who brings the Fire—she is adventurous, embracing life with open arms, thoughtful, giving, and full of spark. And we have Tommy, who brings the Water—sweet, bright, family-loving, and possessing a calm so deep that some might call it "slow," but we know it is simply the steady, unhurried rhythm of a peaceful soul. Harry is the perfect alchemy of this fire and water.

                    <span class="acrostic-letter">R</span>emembering where we come from gives us roots to grow. Harry's first name is a loving tribute to his great-grandfather, Robin's grandfather, connecting him to a deep legacy of strength. And his middle name, Slater, holds a special piece of Kelli's family history; it is his grandmother's maiden name, chosen by her father on Staten Island. These names are more than just words; they are an embrace from the past.

                <div class="acrostic-paragraph">
                    <span class="acrostic-letter">R</span>ecalling our ancient traditions, we look to the Torah to understand the weight of his Hebrew name. We remember the story of Yaakov, who worked seven years for Lavan to earn the hand of Rachel. But Lavan, in his trickery, gave him Leah instead. Yaakov, driven by love, worked another seven years to finally be with Rachel. It is a story of persistence, but also of destiny.

                <div class="acrostic-paragraph">
                    <span class="acrostic-letter">Y</span>et, it is the story of Leah that matters most today. When she gave birth to her third son, she named him Levi, saying:
                    <span class="hebrew-container">
                        <span class="hebrew-text">וַתַּ֣הַר עוֹד֘ וַתֵּ֣לֶד בֵּן֒ וַתֹּ֗אמֶר עַתָּ֤ה הַפַּ֙עַם֙ יִלָּוֶ֤ה אִישִׁי֙ אֵלַ֔י כִּֽי־יָלַ֥דְתִּי ל֖וֹ שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה בָנִ֑ים עַל־כֵּ֥ן קָרָֽא־שְׁמ֖וֹ לֵוִֽי</span>
                    </span>
                    (Genesis 29) "Now this time, my husband will be joined to me." The name Levi literally means "to attach" or "to join." It was a plea for connection, for a bond that could not be broken.

Just as the tribe of Levi became the ones who united the Jewish people in service and musical worship, may Harry be the glue that holds his friends and family together. May he possess the magnetic ability to join people in love and friendship.
