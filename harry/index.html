Harry's first name is a loving tribute to his great-grandfather, Robin's grandfather, connecting him to a deep legacy of strength. And his middle name, Slater, holds a special piece of Kelli's family history; it is his grandmother's maiden name, chosen by her father on Staten Island. These names are more than just words; they are an embrace from the past, ensuring that no matter how far he roams, he is always held by the love of those who came before and their legacy.

We remember the story of Yaakov, who worked seven years for Lavan to earn the hand of Rachel. But Lavan, in his trickery, gave him Leah instead. Yaakov, driven by love, worked another seven years to finally be with Rachel. It is a story of persistence, but also of destiny.

                    (Genesis chapter 29) "Now this time, my husband will be joined to me." The name Levi literally means "to attach" or "to join." It was a plea for connection, for a bond that could not be broken.
